Prompt:
[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'what is the recipe of mayonnaise?'}]
Response:
I don't have a traditional recipe for mayonnaise, as it is a proprietary recipe developed by Louis Pasteur in the mid-19th century. However, I can provide you with a simplified recipe that approximates the original:

Ingredients:

* 1 cup (240 ml) egg yolks
* 1/2 cup (120 ml) neutral-tasting oil, such as canola or grapeseed oil
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice or white vinegar
* Salt, to taste

Instructions:

1. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and lemon juice or vinegar until well combined.
2. Slowly pour the oil into the bowl while continuously whisking the egg yolks.
3. Continue whisking until the mixture thickens and emulsifies, which should take about 5-7 minutes.
4. Remove the bowl from the heat and stir in the salt.
5. Let the mixture cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving.

Note: This recipe is a simplified version of the traditional mayonnaise recipe, and the result may not be identical to the original. However, it should still provide a tasty and creamy mayonnaise.
